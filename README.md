# Dumbbell-Viz-with-Nig-Petroleum-Products-Prices

Nigerian President Bola Tinubu's decision to eliminate petrol subsidies in May has had a substantial influence on the country's fuel prices. Petrol prices in Nigeria have now surpassed 617 naira per litre, the highest in the country's history. The elimination of petrol subsidies was a contentious issue, with some saying that it would cut government spending while others argued that it would result in higher fuel costs and more hardship for regular Nigerians. The decision has undoubtedly resulted in higher fuel costs. The average price of petrol in May was roughly 230 naira per litre. Now, the price has more than doubled to 617 naira per litre. Given that petrol is a key component of transportation expenditures, this has, and will continue to have a considerable influence on Nigerians' cost of living. This emergent trend is expected to have a variety of ramifications for the Nigerian economy. Increased inflation is predicted as businesses pass on increased fuel prices to consumers. It is also expected to limit economic development since businesses will be less profitable and consumers will have less money to spend.
